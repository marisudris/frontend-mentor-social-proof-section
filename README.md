## My process

As usual - I derived the proper markup first, that's both semantic and provides the necessary styling hooks.
After that - saving the necessary properties from the style guide (mostly theme colors) and then - themobile layout using top-down approach - deriving the major layout and the details afterwards - mostly using column _flex_ (and a little _grid_ for card headers).
Afterwards I did the desktop layout using _grid_ for major component layout and stayed mostly with
_flex_ for the individual parts.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

There can be multiple ways to do a layout and sometimes there isn't a specific indicator for one specific solution. Sometimes a preferable solution pops out later during the project - that's why writing modular and well organized CSS matters - it's more readable and makes it easier to refactor later.
